<!-- 
Object defnition
key-value structure.
Dot vs Bracket.
Nesting and deep acess.
object destructing.
Looping: for-in,Object.keys, Object.entries 
copieng objects: spread, Object.assign ,deep clone.
Optional chaining, computed properties.


Objects:- n JavaScript, an object is a collection of key–value pairs.
Each value can be anything: number, string, array, function, another object, etc.

Objects help us store structured data in a single place.


Syntax:-let person = {
  name: "Masthan",
  age: 33,
  city: "Mumbai"
};

Accessing values:

 console.log(person.name);      // Dot notation
console.log(person["city"]);   // Bracket notation

Adding new properties:-
     
person.job = "Developer";
person["weight"] = 75;

Updating values:
      person.age = 34;

      Deleting a property:-
          delete person.city;

          <script>

let person = {
  name: "Masthan",
  age: 33,
  city: "Mumbai"
};

let aa ="name"

obj.aa will not given the ans if you think aa will convert
obj[aa] aa will convert to name and name inside obj.


nesting and deep object.

let person = {
   name: "Masthan",
   age: 33,
 address:{
   city: "Mumbai",
  location:{
    lat:23.9,
    lan:33.4
  }
}
};

console.log(person);

To Acess deep object "person.address.location.lat"
23.9

NOTE:- WHEN EVER TO GOT THE ERROE  LIKE this
       "VM372:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lat')"
        THEN THE ERROR IS NOT FROM LAT ITS FROM PROPERTY BEFORE VALUE HERE IT IS FROM 
        LOCATIONS.

OBJECT DESTRUCTRING:-

  let person = {
   name: "Masthan",
   age: 33,
 address:{
   city: "Mumbai",
  location:{
    lat:23.9,
    lan:33.4
  }
}
};

let {lat,lan} = person.address.location. 

LOOPING:- for-in, Object.keys.Object.entries,

let obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software"
};

for(let key in obj){
    console.log(key,obj[key]);
    
}

generally we know that if we want to acess any value from 
object we will wrire like obj.name etc etc but in looping we cant write like that
here we use obj.key also it not give ans so we write like 
obj[key] it prints only values if you want key also 
you can write like " console.log(key, obj[key])"


Object.keys:- it will covert all keys of onject into Array

 let obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software"
};
console.log(Object.keys(obj));// ['name', 'age', 'work']


Object.entries:- it will conerts evert key value pair ibn to single single Array


['name', 'masthan'], ['age', 33], ['work', 'software']

copying objects:

  let obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software"
};

console.log(obj)

let obj2 = Object.assign({price:23},obj)
console.log(obj2);

let obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software",
    address:{
        city:"Nellore",
        mainAdress:{
     dno: 24-4
        }
    }
};

let obj2 = {...obj}
console.log(obj2)
 Shallow copy: when we copy the elements by using shallow copy means like 
 by using spread operater  or object.assing it will it will change first layer of object only so when you 
 change values from copied object it will change the original object also changed .

 Deep copy: in deeo copy it will change full object including nested objects also. 

let obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software",
    address:{
        city:"Nellore",
        mainAdress:{
     dno: 24-4
        }
    }
};

let obj2=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
console.log(obj2);


Optional chaining and computed properties:

obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software",
    address:{
        city:"Nellore",
        mainAdress:{
     dno: 24-4
        }
    }
};

if some property may not exist or if you write adress as adres 
then it throws error . 
 so you can use optional chaining.address

 obj.addres?.city

 Computed Properties means:

 Creating object keys dynamically using a variable or expression instead of writing the key directly.

In simple words:
“Key name dynamic ga create ayye object property.”

 let role ="admin"
obj ={
    name :"masthan",
    age:33,
    work : "software",
    address:{
        city:"Nellore",
        mainAdress:{
     dno: 24-4
        }
    },
    [role]: "vali"
};

console.log(obj.admin);
