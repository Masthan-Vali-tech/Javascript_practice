<script>
          FOR:- if we know exactly how many times we want to repeat something we use for loop
          Syntax: for(start; end; change){

          };

          while:-if we want to run a loop as long as a conditon is true we use while loop
          syntax:  start
                   while(end){
                      change;
                   }

          do-while:-we if we want to run a loop atleast one time first and then
                   continue only if the condition is true;

        1.print numbers from 1 to 100 using for loop.

        for(i=1 ; i<=100; i++){
            console.log(i);

          }

        2. print numbers from 10 to 1 using while loop.

            let i=10
           while(i>0){
            console.log(i);

            i--;
           }
        3.print even numbers from 1 to 20 using for loop.

        for(i=1;i<21;i++){
            if(i%2===0){
                console.log(i)
            }
        }

        4.print odd numbers from 1 to 15 using while loop.

        let i =1;
        while(i<16){
            if (i%2===1){
                console.log(i);

            }
            i++;
        }

        5.print the multiplication table of 5(i.e 5*1=5.....5*10 =50);

        for(let i=1; i<10; i++){
            console.log(5*i);
           or
             console.log(`5 * ${i} = ${5*i}`);

        }

        6.find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

          let sum = 0;
          for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
            sum = sum + i;

            console.log(sum);
          }

        Note:- we must write sum out side of  for loop because when we write sum
        inside for loop it refreshes every time the loop runs so to hold updated CSSMathValuewe must declare
        out side the loop  and console when we write inside for loop it will give
        like 1,3,6,10 .... so we declare outside which will give total sum "5050"

        7.print all numbers between 1 to 50 that are divisible by 3

          for (let i = 1; i < 52; i++) {
            if (i % 3 === 0) {
              console.log(i);
            }
          }

        8.ask the user for a number and print weather each number from "1 is odd","2 is even".

          let val = prompt("give a number i will show you it even or odd");

          for (let i = 1; i <= val; i++) {
            if (i % 2 === 0) {
              console.log(`${i} is even`);
            } else {
              console.log(`${i} is odd`);
            }
          }

        9.count how many numbers between 1 to 100 are divisible by both 3 and 5

        for (let i = 1; i < 100; i++) {
          if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log(i);
          }
        }

      BREAK AND CONTINUE:---
              1. stop at first multiples of 7
  
                   write a loop from 1 to 100 that:
                     .prints each Number
                     .stops completly when it finds the
                      first number divisible by 7

                for (let i=1; i<101; i++){
                    if(i % 7 === 0){
                        break;
                    }
                    console.log(i);

                }


         2.skip multiples of 3

             write a loop from 1 to 20 that:
                  .skips numbers divisible by 3
                  .print all others

                  for(let i=1; i<21; i++){
                      if(i%3===0) continue;
                          console.log(i);


                  }


        3. print first 5 odd numbers onplay

           write a loop from 1 to 100 that :
            .    prints only 5 odd numbers
            .    then stops the loop

        let count =0;
        for(let i=1; i<101; i++){
            if(i%2===1){
                count++;
                console.log(i);

            }
            if(count === 5) break
        }
